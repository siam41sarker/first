The fragrance will be decanted into bottles highlighted in the secondary image.. The key to the audacity, success and drive of the creatives who make the wildest dreams a reality. An immaterial energy that is nurtured by travel and experiences that forge a new state of mind. A creative impulse that has always guided Jacques Cavallier Belletrud. With an over-generous dose of Ambrox, perfumery’s white gold, the Master Perfumer reinvents the ambery accord to express a sensual and contemporary masculine elegance. Its contrasts appear upon contact with noble citrus and black tea from China extracted with CO2, a magical ingredient that carries within it the soul of travel. With Imagination, the spirit rises, escapes and conquers new paths of freedom.\n\nDisclaimer – Please Read Before Purchase\n\nStallion Scents are not directly affiliated with, endorsed, sponsored nor supported by any of the brands we sell.

The fragrance will be decanted into bottles highlighted in the secondary image.\n\nthe day passes, the path of the sun creates shimmering patterns of shadow and light on the dunes. While everything else seems motionless, the desert comes alive and draws the traveller into a passionate odyssey. Designed for lovers of rare essences, Ombre Nomade concentrates that sensation of infinity into one of the most mythical ingredients in perfumery, oud wood. A rebellious material, intoxicatingly beautiful, which the Master Perfumer Jacques Cavallier Belletrud has faceted with a hint of benzoin and raspberry accents. Far away, a smoky wisp of incense floats towards the heavens. Never has oud been so mystical.\n\nDisclaimer - Please Read Before Purchase\n\nStallion Scents are not directly affiliated with, endorsed, sponsored nor supported by any of the brands we sell.
